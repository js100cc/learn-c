# Learning C

This repo is for learning c programming.

Main learning materials are K&R and Harvard cs50, and other books and online.

## Learning environment

Although C is a cross-platform language, I choose to use Linux to get a good taste.

And use Linux is a natural choice for me, i'm already comfortable with archlinux
and K&R use unix. Also, i learn almost anything in Linux.

Here are some main tools i use to learn c.

### OS

Arch Linux. Linux kernel 5.7.12+.

### Shell

1. bash 5.0.17+
2. zsh 5.8+

### C compilers

1. gcc 10.1.0+
2. clang 10.0.1+

### Editor

vim 8.2+ and plugins.

##  Why bother ?

1. C is de facto for almost all. Or, it's genes impart to many latecomers.
2. Many *serious* computer books use c to introduce low-level computing. I want
   learn them in the long run.  


## Study notes

No notes written in markdown, all of them are directly written in source code comments.

Read the code and comments for recap.
