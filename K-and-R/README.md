# Learning The C Programming Language(K&R)

It's an old book, but it's still standard C.

It's definitely a great book although i only recently learnt the first chapter.

K&R 2nd published in 1988, UNIX written in C in 1973, Linux written in
C in 1991, a lot of programs still insist written in ANSI C.

No matter what other guys talk about how other c books are more suitable for
nowadays, read K&R.

It's true that it's not a perfect book for absolute programming beginner, but
if you already have some experience especially Linux experience, learn K&R
should be a lot of fun.

K&R is very hard-core, tree-saving book but still relatively clear and very
programming training-like. Programming is not about reading, it's about doing.
K&R is about 280 pages, you can read it in one day or you can do it in several
months.

As a not so fresh programmer, i choose to practice as many as i can when
learning K&R, and plan to read it at least twice after first round.
